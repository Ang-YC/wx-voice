I. Description

This package contains files for compilation and evaluation of the fixed
point SILK SDK library. The following is included in this package:

    o Source code for the fixed point SILK SDK library
    o Source code for creating encoder and decoder executables
    o Test vectors
    o Comparison tool
    o Microsoft Visual Studio solutions and project files
    o Makefile for GNU C-compiler (GCC)
    
II. Files and Folders

    o doc/          - contains more information about the SILK SDK
    o interface/    - contains API header files
    o src/          - contains all SILK SDK library source files
    o test/         - contains source files for testing the SILK SDK
    o test_vectors/ - contains test vectors   
    o Makefile      - Makefile for compiling with GCC
    o readme.txt    - this file
    o Silk_SDK.sln  - Visual Studio 2010 solution for all SILK SDK code
    o Silk_SDK_VS2005.sln - Visual Studio 2005 solution for all SILK SDK code

III. How to use the Makefile

    1. How to clean and compile the SILK SDK library:
      	  
       make clean lib
 
    2. How to compile an encoder executable:

       make encoder

    3. How to compile a decoder executable:

       make decoder

    4. How to compile the comparison tool:

       make signalcompare

    5. How to clean and compile all of the above:

       make clean all

    6. How to clean and compile for ARM based device using a cross compiler:

       make clean all TOOLCHAIN_PREFIX=(1) TARGET_CPU=(2) TARGET_ARCH=(3)

       (1) Compiler toolchain prefix, most cross-compilers do need to specify that.
       (2) Target CPU, e.g. arm1136jf-s or cortex-a8, depends on the compiler. (makefile passes -mcpu= to the compiler)
       (3) Target architecture, e.g. armv6 or armv7, depends on the compiler. (makefile passes -march= to the compiler)

    7. How to build for big endian CPU's

       make clean all ADDED_DEFINES+=_SYSTEM_IS_BIG_ENDIAN
       To be able to use the test vectors with big endian CPU's the test programs
       need to be compiled in a different way. Note that the 16 bit input and output 
       from the test programs will have the upper and lower bytes swapped with this setting. 

    8. How to build native C code (no assembly code)

       make clean all ADDED_DEFINES+=NO_ASM

    9. How to use the comparison tool:

       See 'How to use the test vectors.txt' in the test_vectors folder.
